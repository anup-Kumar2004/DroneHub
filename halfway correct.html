            Drone Technlogy: What Is a Drone?
        </h3>

        
        <p class="p-heading">The term drone usually refers to any unpiloted aircraft. Sometimes referred to as unmanned <br> aerial vehicles (UAVs),
            these crafts can carry out an impressive range of tasks, ranging </p>
            
        <p class="p1-heading"> from military operations to package delivery.</p>

                <h1 class = "WIAD-HEADING">What Is a Drone?</h1>
                <p class="p-for-WIAD-heading"> Drones, sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), carry out<br> tasks that range from the mundane 
                    to the ultra-dangerous. These robot-like <br >aircrafts can be found rescuing avalanche victims as well as dropping off <br> groceries at your doorstep
                     — and almost everywhere in between.
                </p>
                <div class="small-grey-rectangle">
                    <h1 class = "DDF-WIAD-HEADING">DRONE DEFINITION: WHAT IS A DRONE?</h1>
                    <p class="p-for-DDF-WIAD-heading"> A drone refers to any aerial vehicle that receives remote commands from a pilot or<br> relies on software
                         for autonomous flight.Many drones display features like cameras <br>for collecting visual data and propellers for stabilizing their flight
                          patterns. Sectors <br>like videography, search and rescue, agriculture and transportation have adopted<br> drone technology.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="p2-for-WIAD-heading"> Originally developed for the military and aerospace industries, drones have <br>found their way into the mainstream because
                    of the enhanced levels of safety <br>and it's efficiency they bring. These robotic UAVs operate without a pilot on <br>board and with different levels of autonomy. 
                </p>

                <p class="p3-for-WIAD-heading"> A drone's autonomy level can range from remotely piloted (a human controls<br> its movements) to advanced autonomy, which means that it relies on a system<br> 
                of sensors and LiDAR  detectors to calculate its movement.
                </p>

                <p class="p4-for-WIAD-heading">Different drones are capable of traveling varying heights and distances. Very<br> close-range drones usually have
                     the ability to travel up to three miles and are<br> mostly used by hobbyists. Close-range UAVs have a range of around 30 miles. <br> Short-range drones travel up to 90 miles and are used primarily
                      for espionage <br>and intelligence gathering. Mid-range UAVs have a 400-mile distance range<br> and could be used for intelligence gathering, scientific studies and alos<br>meteorological research. The 
                      longest-range drones are called “endurance” <br> UAVs and have the ability to go beyond the 400-mile range and up to 3,000 <br>feet in the air.

                </p>

                <p class="p5-for-WIAD-heading"> Because drones can be controlled remotely and can be flown at varying <br>distances and heights, they make 
                    perfect candidates to take on some of the <br> toughest jobs in the world. They can be found assisting in a search for <br> survivors after 
                    a hurricane, giving law enforcement and military an eye-in <br>-the-sky during terrorist situations and advancing scientific research in 
                    some<br> of the  most extreme climates on the planet. Drones have even made their<br> way into our homes and serve as  entertainment for hobbyists 
                    and a vital<br> tool for photographers.</p>

                <h1 class = "HDDW-HEADING">How Do Drones Work?</h1>

                <p class="p6-for-WIAD-heading"> Many parts are involved behind the scenes to support the seamless operation<br> of drones, so it's important to
                    become familiar with the unmanned or remote <br>technology that makes up a drone's system. From delivering commands to<br> ensuring a manageable 
                    weight, pilots must take into account the various <br>factors that make a drone suited for specific jobs. Among the many variables<br> in play,
                    some of the most critical components of a drone to consider are its<br> ground control station (GCS), payload and data links.</p>

                <div class="small2-grey-rectangle">
                    <h1 class = "WIDT-HEADING">WHAT IS DRONE TECHNOLOGY?</h1>
                    <p class="p-for-WIDT-heading">Drones rely on a combination of hardware and software components to achieve<br> successful takeoff, flight and 
                        landing. Drones are often equipped with rotors or fixed <br>wings, sensors, navigation systems and gyroscopes (for stability), and are
                        operated <br>by ground control stations.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class = "UAV-HEADING">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h1>

                <p class="p7-for-UAV-heading"> Drones are commonly referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),<br> whereas the entire system that allows a
                     drone to function is a UAS (Unmanned <br>Aerial System.) The UAV is the heart of the UAS and possesses fixed wings <br>or either a single or 
                     multi-rotary build for flight. Lighter-than-air UAVs, such<br> as blimps and balloons, and small “Flapping Wing” UAVs also exist.</p>


                <div class="small3-grey-rectangle">
                    <h1 class = "UAV-defination-HEADING">UAV DEFINITION</h1>
                    <p class="p-for-UAV-heading">Another name for drones is unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is an aircraft that doesn't require a pilot
                         to be physically onboard. UAVs are often separated into two categories — civilian and military. While civilian UAVs are used for package
                          <br>deliveries and recreation, military drones are used for reconnaissance missions and <br>carrying out offensive strikes on enemy targets.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 class = "GCS-HEADING">Ground Control Station (GCS)</h1>
                
                <p class="p-for-GCS-heading">Ground Control Stations are the central control unit that allows a UAV to fly<br> and a UAS to operate.
                     These stations can be as large as a desk with multiple <br>views to as small as a handheld controller or even an app. The GCS can
                      be <br>user controlled or operated via satellites and is capable of controlling flight,<br> controlling payload sensors, providing
                       status readouts, mission planning and <br>tethering the data link system.
                </p>

                <h1 class = "payloads-heading">Payloads</h1>
                
                <p class="p-for-payloads-heading">Drones, UAVs specifically, come in a variety of sizes and are capable of<br> carrying payloads of equally
                    variable sized payloads. From life-saving <br> medication to packages and more, drones provide an efficient method of <br>delivery but must
                    be built to handle the job at hand. Many drones are capable<br> of rapid flight across oceans while others may be restricted to just
                    a few <br> thousand feet. Some drones may be capable of carrying hundreds of pounds <br>while others can only manage under ten. It is 
                    crucial for operators to choose the <br>right drone to help them complete the job at hand.
                </p>

                <h1 class = "DL-heading">Data Links</h1>
                
                <p class="p-for-DL-heading">Data Links act as the transmission center that allow the drone to communicate<br> with the ground operator while
                    in flight. Typically utilizing radio frequency<br> technology to communicate, the data  link provides the operator with crucial data <br>like
                    remaining flight time, distance from the operator, distance from target,<br> airspeed altitude and more. UAV control at 2.4 GHz for control
                    and 5 GHz for <br>video will provide the operator with approximately four miles of usability, while <br>frequencies of 900 MHz for flight 
                    control and 1.3 GHz for video control can<br> provide more than 20 miles of usability — adding to the list of reasons why pilots<br> must 
                    use the right UAS for the task they mean to achieve.

                <p class="p-for-HDDf-heading">Drones depend on a number of parts working together in order to complete tasks <br>under changing conditions. While 
                    gyroscopes and vertical take-off and landing<br> (VTOL) capabilities make it easier to remotely control drones, GPS and LiDAR <br>technology
                    instill drones with a strong sense of direction. It takes all of these pieces<br> to create a functioning drone that has the capacity to scan 
                    its surroundings while<br> enduring a range of environments.
                </p>

                <h1 class = "VTOL-heading">VTOL Drones</h1>
                
                <p class="p-for-VTOL-heading">Many drones, typically multi-rotor drones, are considered Vertical Take-off and<br> Landing (VTOL) drones due to their
                     ability to take off, fly, hover and land in a<br> vertical position.

            <h1 class = "GNSS-heading">GNSS for Drones</h1>
            <p class="p1-for-GNSS-heading">Found in numerous types of drones, dual Global Navigation Satellite Systems<br> (GNSS) like GPS and GLONASS drones are able 
                to operate in both non-satellite<br> and satellite modes, providing enhanced connectivity during operation.
            </p>

            <p class="p2-for-GNSS-heading">GNSS allows Return to Home safety technology to function on a drone and can<br> be activated through the ground station's remote controller.
                This allows pilots to <br>be informed as to whether there are enough drone GNSS satellites available for<br> the drone to be flown independently,
                the current location of the drone compared<br> to the pilot and the “home point” for the drone to return to. In addition to being<br> controllable
                through the controller, Return to Home can also be automatically <br>activated once the battery is low or when loss of contact between the
                drone and<br> the controller occurs.
            </p>

            <h1 class = "GID-heading">Gyroscopes in Drones</h1>
            <p class="p-for-GID-heading">Gyroscopes consist of a wheel that can spin in any direction on its axis and are <br>used in drones to measure the rate 
                of rotation. Because a gyroscope focuses on <br>the tilt of a drone, it becomes essential for providing stability. This way, drones<br> can maintain 
                their direction and deliver a smooth flying experience.

                Drones come in a variety of types, each tailored to the unique demands of<br> different industries. For instance, some people require 
                lightweight drones to <br>hold a camera for photography, while others need robust drones to transport <br>heavy medical supplies. As a
                result, companies produce drones that come in <br>four main types — single-rotor helicopter, multi-rotor, fixed-wing and fixed- <br>wing
                hybrid VTOL.

            <h1 class = "SRHD-heading">Single-Rotor Helicopter Drones</h1>
                <p class="p-for-SRHD-heading">
                    Single-rotor helicopters look like tiny helicopters and can be gas or electric-<br>powered. The single blade and ability to run on gas
                    help its stability and fly <br>for longer distances. These UAVs are usually used to transport heavier <br>objects, including LiDAR systems,
                    that can be used to survey land, research<br> storms and map erosion caused by global warming.
                </p>

                <h1 class = "ADVANTAGES-heading">Advantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-ADVANTAGES-heading">
                    The stamina of single-rotor drones makes them a popular choice, especially<br> when powered by a gas engine. A single, larger blade is what
                    makes these<br> drones much more efficient during flight, allowing them to outperform their <br>multi-rotor counterparts. As a result, many 
                    pilots rely on single-rotor <br>helicopter drones to carry more weight.
                </p>    

                <h1 class = "DISADVANTAGES-heading">Disadvantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-DISADVANTAGES-heading">
                    Multi-rotor drones still lack the endurance and payload capacity seen in single-<br>rotor helicopter drones. A pilot would be lucky to keep a 
                    multi-rotor drone in the<br> air for over 30 minutes. And while these drones are easier to fly, they become<br> unstable in windy conditions and
                    can't stray too far from their controller. 
                </p>

            <h1 class = "MRD-heading">Multi-Rotor Drones</h1>
                <p class="p-for-MRD-heading">
                    Multi-rotor drones are usually some of the smallest and lightest drones on the<br> market. They have limited distance, speed and height, but make the
                    perfect <br>flying vehicle for enthusiasts and aerial photographers. These drones can usually<br> spend 20-30 minutes in the air carrying a lightweight 
                    payload, such as a camera. 
                </p>

                <h1 class = "ADVANTAGES1-heading">Advantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-ADVANTAGES1-heading">
                    Multi-rotor drones are probably the most accessible drones available to the<br> public, since they are easy to control and maneuver during flight.
                    Some multi<br>-rotor drones are ideal for beginner pilots as well, leading to them being an<br> affordable option in the drone market.

                <p class="p-for-FWD-heading">
                    Fixed-wing drones look like normal airplanes, where the wings provide the lift<br> instead of rotors- making them very efficient. These drones 
                    usually use fuel<br> instead of electricity, allowing them to glide in the air for more than 16 hours.<br> Since these drones are usually much larger,
                    and because of their design, they<br> need to take off and land on runways just as airplanes do. Fixed-wing UAVs are <br>used by the military to carry
                    out strikes, by scientists to carry large amounts of<br> equipment and even by nonprofits to deliver food and other goods to areas that<br> are hard
                    to reach.

                <h1 class = "ADVANTAGES2-heading">Advantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-ADVANTAGES2-heading">
                    Fixed-wing drones are durable and can cover longer distances and carry heavier<br> objects than other drones. Their sturdy frame also enables them 
                    to withstand <br>windier conditions, remaining steady while maintaining a swift travel speed.

                <h1 class = "DISADVANTAGES2-heading">Disadvantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-DISADVANTAGES2-heading">
                    Because fixed-wing drones cannot hover and must be moving forward at all times,<br> they are much more difficult to land than other drones. They need 
                    plenty of space <br>to take off and touch down, just like regular airplanes. As a result, fixed-wing <br>drones require extensive training and reside on 
                    the higher end of the price spectrum.

            <h1 class = "FWHD-heading">Fixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL Drones</h1>
                <p class="p-for-FWHD-heading">
                    Fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones are a blend of fixed-wing drones and rotor<br>-based drones, featuring rotors that are attached to the
                    wings. Due to its hybrid <br>approach, this technology offers users the endurance of a fixed-wing design and<br> the vertical flying
                    capabilities of a rotor-focused design. Companies take<br> advantage of this combination, relying on fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones
                    to<br> further cut down on delivery times while offering a more versatile flight <br>experience. 
                </p>
                <h1 class = "ADVANTAGES3-heading">Advantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-ADVANTAGES3-heading">
                    Fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones have the stamina needed to travel long distances,<br> even while handling heftier payloads. They also 
                    have the ability to fly vertically and<br> hover, offering more versatility than fixed-wing drones. 
                </p>
                <h1 class = "DISADVANTAGES3-heading">Disadvantages</h1>
                <p class="p-for-DISADVANTAGES3-heading">
                    Fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones operate as a jack of all trades, performing many<br> tasks while not specializing in any area. In 
                    other words, they can fly forward and <br>hover, but they're not great at either. Pilots also need training to fly these drones<br> 
                    and must be willing to pay more for them. This technology is new and still<br> developing, so more flaws could arise as the industry
                    continues to experiment with <br>fixed-wing hybrid VTOL drones.
